# PDF Summarization with Next.js

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project that allows users to upload a PDF file and receive a summarized version of its content. The project leverages the [pdf.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) library for PDF parsing and a custom API endpoint for text summarization using [OctoAI](https://www.octoai.com/).

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pdf-summarization-nextjs.git
cd pdf-summarization-nextjs
npm install
# or
yarn install


```
